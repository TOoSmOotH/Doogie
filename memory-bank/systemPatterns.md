# System Patterns

This document captures recurring architectural patterns, coding standards, and best practices for the Doogie project.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture
- **UI Layer**: Handles user interaction and display
- **Application Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations
- **Domain Layer**: Implements core models and business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides technical capabilities (database, external services)

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Components should receive their dependencies rather than creating them
- Facilitates testing and component replacement
- Reduces tight coupling between modules

### 3. Repository Pattern
- Abstract data access behind repository interfaces
- Separate data access logic from business logic
- Enable easier switching of data sources if needed

### 4. Service Pattern
- Encapsulate business operations in service classes
- Services coordinate between repositories and domain objects
- Focus on single responsibility principle

### 5. Factory Pattern
- Use factories to create complex objects
- Especially for RAG components and LLM connectors
- Enables runtime configuration and selection

## Code Standards

### Python Conventions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- Use virtual environments for dependency management

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Aim for high test coverage of core functionality
- Use mocks for external dependencies

### Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log exceptions with appropriate context
- Graceful degradation when possible

## Security Patterns

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password storage with appropriate hashing
- API key encryption in the database

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Secure handling of user data and API keys

## Performance Patterns

### Caching
- Cache expensive operations
- Consider caching at multiple levels (result cache, embedding cache)
- Implement cache invalidation strategy

### Asynchronous Processing
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Queue long-running tasks for background processing
- Implement progress tracking for document processing

## Frontend Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture
- Reusable UI components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent styling and theming

### State Management
- Centralized state management
- Clear data flow between components
- Local state for UI-specific concerns

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Consistent user experience across devices
