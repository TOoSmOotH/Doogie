- Implemented database schema with SQLAlchemy
- Created database models for users, documents, chunks, graph nodes/edges, chats
- Implemented core API structure with FastAPI
- Created authentication routes and JWT implementation
- Implemented document processing skeleton
- Created mock LLM connector for development
- Implemented mock RAG retriever for development
- Fixed SQLite database access issues in Docker by using bind mounts
- Fixed frontend-build permission issues by setting user to 1000 in Docker Compose
- Fixed TypeScript error in useAuth.tsx by adding React import
- Created missing frontend pages (Register, Chat, Documents, Settings, Admin)
- Removed obsolete 'version' attribute from docker-compose.yml
- Fixed frontend static file serving by using absolute path in main.py
- Fixed React AuthProvider error by wrapping App in AuthProvider in main.tsx
- Enhanced user authentication system with environment variables and password reset
- Implemented document processing pipeline with real text extraction for multiple formats
- Implemented sophisticated chunking strategies based on document types
- Implemented BM25 indexing using Pyserini
- Implemented FAISS vector search for embeddings
- Implemented GraphRAG using NetworkX
- Integrated neural reranking with cross-encoder models
- Replaced Pyserini with pure Python rank_bm25 library to eliminate Java dependency
- Fixed bcrypt compatibility issue by specifying bcrypt==4.0.1 in requirements.txt
- Fixed authentication issues in frontend by properly formatting API requests:
  - Updated registration to use proper Content-Type header
  - Fixed login to use form data with correct Content-Type for OAuth2
  - Added detailed error logging for debugging
  - Made full_name required in UserCreate schema
  - Added from_attributes to UserBase config for proper ORM integration
  - Improved error handling to display specific backend error messages to users
- Identified and documented frontend development workflow issue:
  - Analyzed why UI changes aren't being reflected in the Docker environment
  - Created documentation explaining the issue (frontend-build-issue.md)
  - Proposed three solutions with detailed implementation plans (docker-compose-dev-proposal.md)
  - Added decision record for frontend development workflow enhancement (DEC-20250312-01)
- Fixed UI theme implementation and modernized UI:
  - Updated Settings.tsx to properly respect dark/light theme
  - Fixed theme-specific styling for panels, forms, inputs, and buttons
  - Ensured consistent theme application across all UI components
  - Removed hardcoded dark theme classes from index.html body tag
  - Modernized UI with a more professional design similar to Claude interface
  - Updated color scheme with new primary colors and better dark/light mode contrast
  - Improved layout spacing and component sizing for better usability
  - Enhanced sidebar and navigation styling for a more modern look

## Immediate Next Steps
- Implement the proposed frontend development workflow enhancement:
  - Add a dedicated frontend development container with hot reloading
  - Update docker-compose.yml to include the new frontend-dev service
  - Document the new development workflow for the team
- Implement Ollama server connection
- Implement API-based LLM integration (OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter)
- Implement model selection functionality
- Implement response generation
- Implement system prompt management
- Continue frontend development with the improved workflow

## Open Questions
- Best approach for handling streaming responses from different LLM providers
- Optimal prompt templates for different types of queries
- Strategies for context window management with large documents
- Performance considerations for hybrid search in production
- Security best practices for API key storage and management
- Integration strategy for external embedding models (Ollama/OpenAI)
- How to balance development and production Docker configurations for optimal developer experience
